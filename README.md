# Dijkstra
Visualisation of Dijkstra's algorithm usage for finding shortest path in graph

# Status

Project is currently abandoned. Everything in src is licensed under WTFPL (see LICENSE)

## Compilation

### Compiling on windows

0_o

### Compiling on Linux

You will need:
 * Compiler w/ C++11 support (I use GCC 5.2.1, but GCC 4.x should work just fine)
 * SFML 2.3 libs (system, window, graphics)
 * Make (optional, current makefile is configured for g++-5 with `-std=c++14`)

If you have GCC 5 installed, then just `./build.sh`

## Usage

Just run `./test.sh` in your terminal or execute `./bin/dijkstra`

### Controls

Current default controls:
 * Double-click to create a node
 * Right click on a node to delete it
 * Click and drag from node to node to create an edge
 * To remove edge, do same thing
 * LShift + LClick - set node as beginning node
 * LShift + RClick - set node as destination node
